# Phaedra

A software that summarizes texts, selects key concepts and allows you to ask questions, using AI. Aimed towards people with intellectual disabilities and neurodivergent individuals, also accommodating several other types of disability. At the same time, it aims to revolutionize the way we consume knowledge. We want to make work and education -especially STEM- more accessible to disabled and neurodivergent humans.

This project was made for [HackMIT 2021](https://hackmit.org/).
