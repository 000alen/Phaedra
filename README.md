# Getting started

Phaedra is currently in a prototype state and is being actively developed. As of right now, the backend can be hosted either locally or using Google Colaboratory as a service provider. The latter option is recommended because of processing requirements.

## Running (developing and testing)

Run the backend locally (or serve it from [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/github/000alen/Phaedra/blob/master/backend/Phaedra_LocalMode.ipynb)):

```console
foo@bar:~$ cd backend
foo@bar:~$ python -m Phaedra.API
```

Then, run the frontend (client):

```console
foo@bar:~$ cd frontend
foo@bar:~$ yarn start
```
